Sunday morning silence, curtain stay closed late
No one thinks of kitchens mornings in a filthy state
Dishes cups and beer stains, ashtrays on the floor
Sunday morning papers are left outside the front door
Sunday school and Sunday roast
Sunday papers Sunday post
Sunday morning Sunday rest
Sunday sermon Sunday best
(Sunday, bloody sunday rest)
Glass of fizzy water helps to start the day
Sit and listen to Sunday silence, problems fade away
Sunday cars and drivers break the morning air
Uncollected milk outside reveals there's no one there
Sunday school and Sunday roast
Sunday papers Sunday post
Sunday morning Sunday rest
Sunday sermon Sunday best
Sunday school and Sunday roast
Sunday papers Sunday post
Sunday morning Sunday rest
Sunday sermon Sunday best
Bathrobes hang in waiting, windows steaming up
Somewhere in the sink downstairs lies an unwashed cup
Tea and toast for breakfast clear away the plates
Wash-up prepare for cooking Sunday lunch awaits
Sunday lunch awaits
Sunday lunch awaits
